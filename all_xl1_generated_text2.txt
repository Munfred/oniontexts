In One Of The Most Amusing Movies Of All Time, This Man Can't Believe He's Holding A $50 Bill On His Hand And His Pants Are Tattered
 
 
In the most recent installment of what has become one of the most beloved franchises in Hollywood history, this movie's climactic scene was the highlight of the summer: In one of the most amusing movies of all time, this man can't believe he's holding a $50 bill on his hand and his pants are torn.

This is every movie fan's favorite moment of the week, and it's hard not to mention the moment in which the man can't believe he's still holding a $50 bill on the hand of a man he knows and loves.

When this man pulls his wallet out from his pocket and asks the guy in front of him if he can help him with the bill, the guy has some time to reply, "No, thank you," and the man in front of him continues to hold the money. The scene then cuts to the man in front of him holding the money, which he suddenly understands as the moment when he realized he didn't have it with him on his hand for something, because he forgot to bring the money with him.

It's also hard to not see the humor in the fact that the person in front of him has a $50 bill, and the fact that everyone else at the movie theater is doing the same thing.

The scene then cuts to the man seemingly holding the $50 on the hand of a woman he's never spoken to before, who shows him how to get rid of the money, and he suddenly realizes that he can't remember how to do it.

It's hard to watch this scene without laughing at the fact that this guy is holding a $50 bill in his hand and he can't believe he's not holding his wallet.

One fan who saw the movie during its release said the scene was so funny because he couldn't believe that the guy in front of him was doing the exact same thing he was doing.

"It was just one of those moments where you see someone you know doing something funny and you realize that he doesn't know any of the same thing you do," said the man in front of him, who then pulled out the $50 and threw it in the air. "I thought I knew what I was doing, but I just couldn't get it any more."

The man in front of him then stopped holding his wallet and got up to ask the woman in front of him if he could help her, but she said he already knows how to do it and she wasn't really interested.

In One Of The Most Amusing Movies Of All Time, This Woman Gets It On With An Other Guy
 
 
Here's a movie that many people will remember as a cinematic masterpiece: In one of the most entertaining movies of all time, this woman gets it on with an other guy.

The scene begins with the woman in the movie sitting on the couch in her apartment, casually chatting with her boyfriend and eating a banana, but then, she suddenly suddenly gets at home to find herself in a completely different room.

"Mmmm, it's nice out today," she says in her new life, now that she's in a different room from where she is now. "So, I was just sitting here and now it's like I'm a different place. Wow, I didn't think I was going to get to sit in this room for a while."

The woman then suddenly realizes that she was talking to a guy on the other couch, who she had been chatting with earlier, and tries to redirect the conversation to him.

The woman then suddenly realizes that she was talking to an attractive man, and attempts to text him, but he's not listening to her and she goes to find him even more attractive and he's even more busy trying to hold hand with her.

The man in front of her then suddenly starts kissing her, and she immediately gets it on with him.

"I'm just enjoying being able to have sex with someone other than myself," she says. "I'm just enjoying being able to have sex with someone else, and that's perfectly fine with me."

The man in front of her then suddenly gets up to go find the other guy, who walks over to her couch and refuses to kiss her as she tells him to, but she's not listening to him and when he returns, she's back on the couch with him and he's not even on the movie's screen.
