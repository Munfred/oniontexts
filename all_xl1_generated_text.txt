Unable To Find Quality Adult Humorous Children's Books About The Bible
 
 
AUSTIN, TX--Densely populated with vivid pictures that capture the spirit of the book's timeless themes, publisher HarperCollins announced Monday that it has found a quality adult novel about the Bible with a fresh new look and a fresh new plot. 

"This is a must-read for any serious Christian," said publisher HarperCollins Publishers CEO Ian Verney, who described his novel as "the most captivating and thought-provoking work about The Bible we've published to date." "Whether you're a seasoned reader or a complete newbie to the series, anyone can discover a new twist on the familiar characters, uncover a hidden secret history of the ancient world, or just imagine a story set in a world where the Bible's characters don't always behave the way they do." 

"This one truly has it all," he added. 

Vinner said that his novel, which has been translated from the original German into more than 30 languages, is the first book to take the leap of faith by reinventing the book's fundamental premise. 

"In this exciting adventure about a group of unlikely survivors who find themselves stranded on a strange and dangerous island, The Brothers Karner White is the perfect choice for anyone who loves the Bible," Vinner said. "From the vibrant descriptions of the stunning landscape to the thrilling tale of one man's struggle to survive in the harsh environment of a mysterious and forbidding land, The Brothers Karner White is a must-read for anyone who has ever read one of the bestselling Christian books about the Bible." 

Like his previous work, the novel follows the story of a group of men who, after meeting an elderly man of their own age and learning something about Christianity, decide to take their lives in the Christian faith. However, The Brothers Karner White differs in that it is set in America during the 19th century, instead of the 16th century, when the book begins. 

"The premise of The Brothers Karner White is that the world has been changed by a devastating plague," Vinner said. "The plague has ravaged all of Christian Europe, and the survivors must find a way to survive in a hostile land. But, as any good story of this period begins with, The Brothers Karner White begins with The Plague." 

Vinner noted that The Brothers Karner White's plot is at once familiar and fresh, and also offers readers a glimpse of a world in which the Bible's characters are more than simply ordinary. 

Vinner said The Brothers Karner White is a book that takes readers to a new place and time, and there is "nothing quite like the world of The Brothers Karner White." 

"The Brothers Karner White takes place in the early 1900s, when the world is a very different place than it was in The Bible, and The Brothers Karner White takes place quite a few years after The Bible," Vinner said. "In The Brothers Karner White, the world is a much better place than it was in The Bible, because the world is now a much better place than it was in The Bible." 

Vinner said The Brothers Karner White is also unique in that it does not make reference to a world outside its world. 

"The world of The Brothers Karner White is a world where humanity's flaws are redeemable, and the world of The Brothers Karner White is a world outside the world," Vinner said. "In The Brothers Karner White, the world is a world and the world is a place, but in The Brothers Karner White, the world is the place and the place is the place and the place is the place." 

Vinner said The Brothers Karner White's novel is a "classic" that offers readers a summary of the plot of The Bible, as well as a detailed description of the characters' lives in that novel. 

"In The Brothers Karner White, the world is a world and the world is a place," Vinner said. "But, of course, The Brothers Karner White is a place and the place is the place." 

Vinner said The Brothers Karner White's plot is also at once familiar and fresh. 

"The Brothers Karner White is a contemporary story, in that the main focus of the story is on the men who are trapped on an island and must survive in a hostile environment," Vinner said. "The Brothers Karner White has a fresh new twist on the formula by having the island be called 'The Island,' in contrast to The Brothers Karner White's place being called 'The Island.'" 

Vinner added that The Brothers Karner White's plot has a familiar structure. "The first thing you see in The Brothers Karner White is a mountain pass where the men go to meet a shipwreck
